# Installation

> **NOTE** - whether creating a new application or upgrading an existing, it shouldn't be necessary to manually install `d2-app-scripts` as a devDependency.

> See the [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping) section for details on how to set up a platform application.

To install the [App Platform Scripts](scripts) tool `d2-app-scripts` as a devDependency in an existing package

```sh
> yarn add --dev @dhis2/cli-app-scripts
```

When installed as a local devDependency, you can use the `d2-app-scripts` executable from within scripts in you `package.json` file.
