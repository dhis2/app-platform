title: App Icon
---

The App Icon should allow a user to quickly and uniquely identify your application. It will appear in the DHIS2 App Hub and in the list of available applications in the Headerbar of a running DHIS2 instance.

## Specifying a Custom App Icon

To specify a custom App Icon, place the relevant file in the `public` directory and name it `dhis2-app-icon.png`. It must be in PNG format, and should include a transparent background. The recommended size of this image is 48x48 pixels. When no `public/dhis2-app-icon.png` is provided, a default icon will be used.
