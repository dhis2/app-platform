# Configuration File Reference

The DHIS2 application platform configuration file is `d2.config.js`.<br/>
It should be placed in the root directory of your project, next to `package.json`

The default export from `d2.config.js` should be a JSON-srializable object.

All properties are technically optional, but it is recommended to set them explicitly.

## Supported Properties

The following configuration properties are supported:

|     **standalone**     |      _boolean_       | **false**         | **ADVANCED** If true, do NOT include a static BaseURL in the production app artifact. This includes the `Server` field in the login dialog, which is usually hidden and pre-configured in production.                                                                                                          |

> _Note_: Dynamic defaults above may reference `pkg` (a property of the local `package.json` file) or `config` (another property within `d2.config.js`).

## Example

```js
const config = {
    name: 'my-app',
    title: 'My Application',
    description: 'A simple application for doing DHIS2 things',

    type: 'app',

    entryPoints: {
        app: './src/App',
    },

    dataStoreNamespace: 'my-custom-app-namespace',
    customAuthorities: ['my-app-analytics-user'],
}

module.exports = config
```

## Setting the DHIS2 version

The `minDHIS2Version` and `maxDHIS2Version` allow specifying which DHIS2 version the app is compatible with. This can be used to have multiple versions of the app on the App Hub, each with their own range of supported DHIS2 versions.

For example, let's say you want to adjust your app to a breaking change in the DHIS2 api. Let's assume that the code on your app's default branch (`main`) has not yet been adapted to the breaking change and that you're working with DHIS2's workflows:

1. Set the `maxDHIS2Version` in `d2.config.js` to the last DHIS2 version that's still compatible with the code on `main`.
1. Branch `main` to a maintenance branch. The recommended naming pattern is `N.x`, where `N` should be replaced with the app's current major version (i.e. `100.x`, `101.x`, etc.). See also [semantic-release's documentation on branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#branches). The app's version can be found in `package.json`, look for the `version` field.
1. On `main` update the `minDHIS2Version` to the first DHIS2 version that contains the breaking change. It's important to publish the `minDHIS2Version` change as a breaking change. An easy way to do that is to include the `BREAKING CHANGE` label in the commit that changes the `minDHIS2Version` (see the [semantic-release documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format) on their commit conventions).
