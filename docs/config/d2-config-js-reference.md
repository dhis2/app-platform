# Configuration File Reference

The DHIS2 application platform configuration file is `d2.config.js`.<br/>
It should be placed in the root directory of your project, next to `package.json`

The default export from `d2.config.js` should be a JSON-srializable object.

All properties are technically optional, but it is recommended to set them explicitly.

It's possible to get TypeScript/Intellisense hints for `d2.config.js` by using this decorator: (available in `@dhis2/cli-app-scripts` > 12.6.0)

```js
// d2.config.js

/** @type {import('@dhis2/cli-app-scripts').D2Config} */
const config = {
    type: 'app',
    ...
}
module.exports = config
```

## Supported Properties

The following configuration properties are supported:

| **viteConfigExtensions** | _string_ or _object_ |  | **ADVANCED** Adds custom options to the Vite config that the App Platform uses to start and build apps. Read more on the [Extending Vite Config](extending-vite-config.md) page |

> _Note_: Dynamic defaults above may reference `pkg` (a property of the local `package.json` file) or `config` (another property within `d2.config.js`).

## Example

```js
const config = {
    name: 'my-app',
    title: 'My Application',
    description: 'A simple application for doing DHIS2 things',

    type: 'app',

    entryPoints: {
        app: './src/App',
    },

    dataStoreNamespace: 'my-custom-app-namespace',
    customAuthorities: ['my-app-analytics-user'],
}

module.exports = config
```

## Setting the DHIS2 version

The `minDHIS2Version` and `maxDHIS2Version` allow specifying which DHIS2 version the app is compatible with. This can be used to have multiple versions of the app on the App Hub, each with their own range of supported DHIS2 versions.

For example, let's say you want to adjust your app to a breaking change in the DHIS2 api. Let's assume that the code on your app's default branch (`main`) has not yet been adapted to the breaking change and that you're working with DHIS2's workflows:

1. Set the `maxDHIS2Version` in `d2.config.js` to the last DHIS2 version that's still compatible with the code on `main`.
1. Branch `main` to a maintenance branch. The recommended naming pattern is `N.x`, where `N` should be replaced with the app's current major version (i.e. `100.x`, `101.x`, etc.). See also [semantic-release's documentation on branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#branches). The app's version can be found in `package.json`, look for the `version` field.
1. On `main` update the `minDHIS2Version` to the first DHIS2 version that contains the breaking change. It's important to publish the `minDHIS2Version` change as a breaking change. An easy way to do that is to include the `BREAKING CHANGE` label in the commit that changes the `minDHIS2Version` (see the [semantic-release documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format) on their commit conventions).

## Additional datastore namespaces

Adds the possibility for apps to declare additional datastore namespaces that should be associated with the app. For each, the user can specify the authorities required to read/write.

Each of the additional namespace objects must declare a namespace name, and authorities by one or more of the following properties:

-   `authorities`: a user needs any of these to read or write
-   `readAuthorities`: a user needs any of these to read
-   `writeAuthorities`: a user needs any of these to write

If `authorities` is combined with read or write limited lists, the entries in authorities are added to the read/write (union).

If only `readAuthorities` are defined, these automatically apply for write.

If only `writeAuthorities` are defined, read is not restricted.

Examples of valid additional namespace objects:

```js
const config = {
    // ...
    additionalNamespaces: [
        { namespace: 'extra1', authorities: ['M_extra1'] },
        { namespace: 'extra2', readAuthorities: ['M_extra2read'] },
        { namespace: 'extra3', writeAuthorities: ['M_extra3write'] },
        {
            namespace: 'extra4',
            authorities: ['M_extra4readwrite'],
            writeAuthorities: ['M_extra4write'],
        },
    ],
}
```
