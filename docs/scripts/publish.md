# d2 app scripts publish

Publishes a built application bundle to the [App Hub](https://apps.dhis2.org/).

You must run `d2 app scripts build` **before** running `publish`

Note that you need an App Hub API key before using this command. The API key is used to identify the user uploading the app. You can generate an API key after logging into the [App Hub](https://apps.dhis2.org/).

This command can only upload _versions_ to an app that **already** exists on the App Hub. The app must have an `id`-field in the `d2.config.js` which matches the id of the app on App Hub.

The API key can be specified with the `D2_APP_HUB_API_KEY` environment variable. For example, the following will publish the app without waiting for user input, given that `id` is in the config-file.

```sh
> d2 app scripts publish
> export D2_APP_HUB_API_KEY=xyz
> d2 app scripts publish --minVersion 2.34 --maxVersion 2.36
```

## Upload a non-platform app

This command can also be used to upload an app-version that is not a DHIS2 platform app. We encourage you to migrate to the DHIS2 platform, but we provide the ability to upload any app.
Use the `--file` option to specify the path to the bundled app .zip file, and use options to specify other required information.

```sh
> d2 app scripts publish --file build/simple-app.zip --file-version 1.0.1 --minDHIS2Version 2.34 --appId <someAppId>
```

Note that your app must still have a manifest that matches the information you provide.

> d2 app scripts publish --help
