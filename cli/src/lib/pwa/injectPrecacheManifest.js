/**
 * Compiles and assembles a manifest of files/urls to precache using Workbox.
 * Since the service worker file lives in the app shell, it will get compiled
 * using the CRA webpack config and added to the shell's `build` directory,
 * where it should be targeted by this `injectPrecacheManifest` function.
 *
 * `injectManifest` from `workbox-build` is used to generate a manifest and
 * inject it into a service worker by using string replacement; see the
 * `injectionPoint` option below. The CRA webpack config does the same thing,
 * using the `self.__WB_MANIFEST` injection point, but it's only configured to
 * add files handled by the webpack compilation process. This script handles
 * all the other files in the app's `build` dir.
