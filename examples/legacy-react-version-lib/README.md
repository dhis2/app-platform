It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `yarn deploy`

This command will prompt you to enter a server URL as well as the username and password of a DHIS2 user with the App Management authority.<br/>
You must run `yarn build` before running `yarn deploy`.<br />
